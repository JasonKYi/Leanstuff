# M4000x LEAN Formalisation

Formalising lecture notes from 1st year Imperial Mathematics course.

Currently mostly done with the M40001 lecture notes in LEAN!
Planning to either do analysis or probability next (or if I'm crazy enough I'll do linear algebra!).

There are some other files too located around all over the place where I try to prove random theorems!
