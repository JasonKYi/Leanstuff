# M4000x LEAN Formalisation

Formalising lecture notes from 1st year Imperial Mathematics course.

Done with the M40001 lecture notes in LEAN (maybe some formating issues left but I don't want to deal with that yet :/)!
Starting to formalise M40002.

## Table of Contents (src/M40002)
* C2. Well-Ordered Principle 
* C2. Countability (I do not plan to work on this any time soon since I don't like countability)
* C2. Bounds, Supremums and Infimums
* C2. Completeness Axiom/Theorem (Not proven yet!) and its corrollaries
* C3. Convergence of Sequences
* C3. Properties of Convergent Sequences
* C3. Cauchy Sequence
* C4. Basic Properties of Convergent Series
* C4. Different Tests for Convergence 


There are some other reference files too (no need to pay too much attention to them :) )!
